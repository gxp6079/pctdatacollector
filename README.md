# CNLE Toolkit

This web application is a comprehension tasks data collector, useful to to gather data while running a code comprehension experiment. Its main goal is to show file source code in different paradigms from different systems to subjects while programmers carry out source code comprehension tasks. It collects programmers' permanence time in each file from each system, as well as the total time per tasks. It also collects data about how programmers switch among files while performing the given tasks. This data is valuable to build what we call the programmers' Cognitive Network of Language Elements and it captures cognitive properties on how the comprehension tasks were preformed.
