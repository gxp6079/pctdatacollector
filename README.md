# Comprehension Tasks Data Collector
We are going to use this web application to gather data while running a code comprehension experiment. The main goal of the web applications is to show file source code in different paradigms from different systems to subjects while they carry out source code comprehension tasks in order to gather programmers' permanence time in each file form each system, as well as the total time per tasks. We also collect data about how programmers switch among files while performing the given tasks.
